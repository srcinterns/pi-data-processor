to put header file:


#NUM_PULSES - amount of time arrays "columns"
#NUM_SAMPLES_PER_PULSE - amount of samples in a time period

#radar_config.h

-> array[NUM_PULSES][NUM_SAMPLES_PER_PULSE]

-> DATA_BUFFER_SIZE - total size of buffer that stores audio data

NOTE: I updated the code, but my computer is being weird so I can't download
 the dependencies.  The Makefile needs to be updated to the new code, and
 the code needs to be compiled.
